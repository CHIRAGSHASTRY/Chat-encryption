# Encrypted Chat Application

This is a simple encrypted chat application using **Python**, **Sockets**, and **RSA encryption**.

## Features
- Secure peer-to-peer messaging using **RSA encryption**.
- Option to **host** or **connect** to a chat.
- Uses **socket programming** for communication.

## Requirements
Make sure you have **Python 3** installed and install the required dependencies:

Security Considerations
RSA key size: Currently 1024-bit, consider increasing to 2048-bit or higher for better security.
No authentication: This is a basic example, real-world applications should implement authentication and additional security layers.
